## Description of the Dataset
__Source of Data:__

The data originates from Kaggle, specifically from the dataset titled “Wind Turbine SCADA Dataset” uploaded by the user Berker İsen. This dataset is publicly accessible. The dataset includes SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) data collected from wind turbines, which is commonly used for monitoring and managing wind turbine operations.

__Data Generation:__

In Wind Turbines, SCADA systems measure and save data like wind speed, wind direction, generated power, etc., for 10-minute intervals. This file was taken from a wind turbine's SCADA system that is working and generating power in Turkey.

__Format and Contents:__

The data is in a CSV file, making it accessible and easy to manipulate using standard data analysis tools. Key columns in the dataset include:
	Date/Time (for 10-minute intervals).
	LV ActivePower (kW): The power the turbine generates for that moment.
	Wind Speed (m/s): The wind speed at the turbine's hub height (the wind speed that the turbine uses for electricity generation).
	Theoretical_Power_Curve (KWh): The theoretical power values that the turbine generates with that wind speed are given by the 		manufacturer.
	Wind Direction (°): The wind direction at the hub height of the turbine (wind turbines turn to this direction automatically.



## Research Objectives

__Objectives:__

Wind energy is a critical component in both large utility networks and small microgrids, providing numerous socio-economic benefits[1]. Two components specifically draw attention to wind power generation: wind speed and wind direction[2]. In this study, we focus on the potential impact on Wind Turbines and relationships between the main variables in a wind turbine SCADA dataset: LV ActivePower, Wind Speed, Wind Direction, and Theoretical Power. By understanding these relationships, we aim to gain the relationship between the natural wind conditions and the turbine's power output and identify potential optimization strategies for energy generation.

## Data Analysis

__Wind Speed vs. Power Generation Analysis:__

1. Create scatter plots of Wind Speed vs. LV ActivePower to visualize the relationship between wind speed and power output.
2. Use binning or smoothing techniques to examine how power generation responds to varying wind speeds, especially in low, 		moderate, and high wind conditions.

***The scatter plot of Wind Speed vs. LV Active Power, gives us the relationship of how power generation reacts as wind speed increases.***



At low wind speeds (0 - 5 m/s), the LV Active Power output is minimal. The graph shows a steep increase in power output as the wind speed increases. This indicates that the turbine starts generating power only after reaching a certain threshold wind speed. From around 5 to 10 m/s, there is a strong positive correlation between wind speed and power output. The power output increases almost linearly with the increase in wind speed. This phase suggests that the turbine captures more wind energy as the wind speed increases, leading to higher power generation. At wind speeds above approximately 10 to 12 m/s, the power output reaches a plateau near the turbine’s maximum power capacity of around 3500 kW. Even with increasing wind speeds (beyond 12 m/s), the power output does not increase and remains stable.

__Wind Direction vs. Power Generation Analysis:__

1. Plot Wind Direction against LV ActivePower to investigate if specific wind directions are associated with higher power generation.
2. Explore whether there is an optimal wind direction for energy generation, which could indicate an alignment effect with turbine orientation.

***The scatter plot of Wind Direction vs. LV Active Power gives us information about which wind direction the LV Active Power reaches its maximum generation power.***

***The polar plot of wind direction vs. LV Active Power, gives us a more precise image from a spatial point of view.***



From the graphs, we can see there are specific ranges of wind directions where the LV Active Power reaches its maximum values, clustering at higher power output levels around 3500 kW. In the 0° to 60° range and 300° to 360° range, there is a dense concentration of points at higher power outputs, indicating that turbines generate more power when the wind comes from these directions. There is a clear pattern where specific wind directions correlate with higher and more consistent power outputs. These directions are likely more favorable for wind energy capture. For directions closer to 0°-60° and 300°-360°, the turbines consistently operate at higher power levels, suggesting these directions align well with the turbine’s optimal performance characteristics.

__Theoretical vs. Actual Power Comparison:__

1. Compare LV ActivePower with Theoretical Power using scatter plots and regression analysis to determine how closely the actual output follows the theoretical predictions.
2. Identify potential inefficiencies in the turbine operation that may contribute to gaps between actual and theoretical power.

***The scatter plot of Wind Speed vs. LV Active Power and Theoretical Power tells us how closely Active Power and Theoretical Power are related. The R2 value is 0.874 in this graph, which shows that the data are statistically quite similar.***



From the graph, we can see the theoretical curve serves as an upper bound, showing the maximum potential for power generation given the wind speed. The actual data often falls below the theoretical curve, which is the real-world data. This could be due to real-world factors, like turbine efficiency, wind conditions, and operational factors. 

__Time Series and Seasonal Analysis:__

1. Analyze power output trends over time, considering seasonal or diurnal variations.
2. Investigate if certain times of day or seasons show different power generation patterns due to changes in wind conditions.

***The scatter plot of Time vs. Power (Active and Theoretical) tells us whether seasonality is a factor that affects power generation.*** 



There is no noticeable trend over time, indicating that power generation does not significantly vary with specific periods or seasons in the dataset. The consistent clustering of data points throughout the year implies that the main factors affecting power generation are not related to the time of the year but are more likely related to real environmental conditions, like wind speed and wind direction. 

## Predictive Modeling

Research Question: Can wind speed and wind direction be used as predictors to accurately estimate the actual power output (LV Active Power) of a wind turbine, and how does the predicted power output compare to the theoretical power curve?

__Predictive Problem and Models__

The predictive problem involves estimating the LV Active Power of a wind turbine based on features of Wind Speed, Wind Direction, and the Theoretical Power Curve. This study is motivated by optimizing turbine efficiency and understanding the differences between theoretical and actual power output. Four models were implemented in this study: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, K-means, and Random Forest. Each model was evaluated for its predictive performance and ability to capture the relationships between the variables.

__Data Processing and Implementation__

1. The dataset was split into an 80% training set, and a 20% testing set. The models were trained on the training set and evaluated on the testing set for all four models.
2. The target variable LV_ActivePower is standardized to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, which ensures uniform data scaling and better algorithm performance. 
3. Polynomial features were added to capture non-linear relationships between wind speed and active power output for Linear Regression and K-means models (decision tree and random forest models would naturally capture the non-linear relationships between features and target variables).

__Modeling Results__

__K-means:__
K-means clustering was applied to group the dataset into k=3 clusters based on the engineered features. The clustering labels were added to the dataset as a categorical variable, enabling the regression model to account for inner-cluster variations.

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): 0.309

The plot shows a generally strong linear relationship between actual and predicted LV Active Power.

__Decision Tree:__
The decision Tree model was chosen because it can handle non-linear relationships and interactions between features. To balance complexity and overfitting, the model was configured with a maximum depth of 10.

The scatter plot shows a linear trend between actual and predicted values, with some deviations, especially for lower and higher values of LV Active Power.

__Linear Regression:__
A multiple linear regression model was used because it is a straightforward method for analyzing relationships between multiple predictors and the target variable. Polynomial terms allow the model to account for non-linear relationships in the data.

## Model Comparisons

***Comparison Chart to compare the four models based on their predictive performance, strengths, and weaknesses.***

Linear Regression: With an MSE of 0.0963 and RMSE of 0.310, it performs well for prediction. 
Its simplicity and interpretability make it practical for capturing primary trends, especially when polynomial features are included to account for non-linear relationships. However, its inability to fully capture complex interactions limits its flexibility. 

Decision Tree: With an MSE of 0.174 and RMSE of 0.418, it demonstrated its ability to model non-linear relationships but could have overfitting and reduced generalization problems, particularly at extreme values of LV Active Power.

K-means(enhanced linear regression model): With an MSE of 0.0952 and RMSE of 0.309, it improved based on standard Linear Regression by incorporating cluster-specific information. The K-means model captured subgroup-specific trends, but its dependency on clustering quality introduced variability in performance.

Random Forest:  With the lowest MSE of 0.0948 and RMSE of 0.308, it performed the best within the four models. Despite minor variations at extreme values, its ensemble structure and resilience to non-linearities enabled it to generalize across the dataset effectively. Random Forest is the best model for forecasting LV Active Power because of its higher accuracy and resilience, despite its higher computational cost.


Overall, Random Forest is recommended as the best model due to its ability to handle complex data relationships, whereas simpler models like Linear Regression and K-Means offer interpretable and competitive alternatives for less complex tasks.
